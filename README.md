## template
This is a template for a design I personally admire. The template is powered by Bumla framework and particle-js library
## directories
* All the webpages should be kept in the template folder
* All the script should be placed in the [script folder](script)
* All the SASS should be placed in the [scss folder](style/scss)
* All the CSS should be placed in the [script folder](style/css)

**Please minify and vendor prefix your compiled CSS for better experience**<br>
**Bulma can be edited via variables.scss**
